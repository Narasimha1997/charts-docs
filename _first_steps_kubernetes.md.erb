Welcome to your new <%= variable :catalog_name, :platform %> application running on Kubernetes! Here are a few questions (and answers!) you might need when first starting with your application.

### What credentials do I need?

You need application credentials that allow you to log in to your new <%= variable :catalog_name, :platform %> application. These credentials consist of a username and password.

### How do I obtain these credentials?

Most <%= variable :catalog_name, :platform %> Helm charts allow you to define these credentials at deploy-time via Helm chart parameters. If not explicitly defined in this manner, the credentials are automatically generated by the Helm chart. Refer to the notes shown after chart deployment for the commands you must execute to obtain the credentials.

### How do I access the deployed application?

Refer to the notes shown after chart deployment for the commands you must execute to obtain the application's IP address.

### How do I access the chart deployment notes?

To see the content of the "Notes" section at any time, execute the command below. Replace MY-RELEASE with the name assigned to your chart deployment.

    $ helm status MY-RELEASE

Here is an example of the output returned by the above command, showing the commands to obtain the IP address and credentials:
