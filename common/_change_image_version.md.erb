To modify the application version used in this chart, specify a [different image tag](https://hub.docker.com/u/bitnami) using the *image.tag* parameter. This approach is also applicable to other images like exporters.

To obtain a list of valid image tags, refer to the corresponding container repository for the image, or refer to [list of available Bitnami container images](https://bitnami.com/stacks/containers).
