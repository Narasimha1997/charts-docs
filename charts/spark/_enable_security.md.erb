### Configure SSL communication

In order to enable secure transport between workers and master deploy the helm chart with this options: ssl.enabled=true

### How to create the certificates secret

It is needed to create two secrets to set the passwords and certificates. The name of the two secrets should be configured on security.passwordsSecretName and security.certificatesSecretName. To generate certificates for testing purpose you can use [this script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/confluentinc/confluent-platform-security-tools/master/kafka-generate-ssl.sh). Into the certificates secret, the keys must be *spark-keystore.jks* and *spark-truststore.jks*, and the content must be text on JKS format. To generate the certificates secret, first it is needed to generate the two certificates and rename them as *spark-keystore.jks* and *spark-truststore.jks*. Once the certificates are created, you can create the secret having the file names as keys.

The second secret, the secret for passwords should have four keys: rpc-authentication-secret, ssl-key-password, ssl-keystore-password and ssl-truststore-password.

Now that the two secrets are created, deploy the chart enabling security configuration and setting the name for the certificates secret (my-secret in this case) at the security.certificatesSecretName and setting the name for the passwords secret (my-passwords-secret in this case) at security.passwordsSecretName.

To deploy chart, use the following parameters:

~~~
security.certificatesSecretName=my-secret
security.passwordsSecretName=my-passwords-secret
security.rpc.authenticationEnabled=true
security.rpc.encryptionEnabled=true
security.storageEncrytionEnabled=true
security.ssl.enabled=true
security.ssl.needClientAuth=true
~~~

> NOTE: Be aware that currently is not possible to submit an application to a standalone cluster if RPC authentication is configured. More info about the issue [here](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-25078).
