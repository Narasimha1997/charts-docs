To submit an application to the cluster use the spark-submit script. You can obtain the script [here](https://github.com/apache/spark/tree/master/bin). For example, to deploy one of the example applications:

    $ ./bin/spark-submit   --class org.apache.spark.examples.SparkPi   --master spark://<master-IP>:<master-cluster-port>   --deploy-mode cluster  ./examples/jars/spark-examples_2.11-2.4.3.jar   1000

Where the master IP and port must be changed by you master IP address and port.

Be aware that currently is not possible to submit an application to a standalone cluster if RPC authentication is configured. More info about the issue [here](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-25078).
