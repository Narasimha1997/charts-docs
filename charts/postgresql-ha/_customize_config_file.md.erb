### *repmgr.conf* / *postgresql.conf* / *pg_hba.conf* / *pgpool.conf* files as configMap

This Helm chart also supports to customize the whole configuration file.

Add your custom files to "files" in your working directory. Those files will be mounted as configMap to the containers and it will be used for configuring Pgpool, Repmgr and the PostgreSQL server.

Alternatively, you can specify the Pgpool, PostgreSQL and Repmgr configuration using the *pgpool.configuration*, *postgresql.configuration*, *postgresql.pgHbaConfiguration*, and *postgresql.repmgrConfiguration* parameters.

In addition to these options, you can also set an external ConfigMap(s) with all the configuration files. This is done by setting the *postgresql.configurationCM* and *pgpool.configurationCM* parameters. Note that this will override the two previous options.

### Allow settings to be loaded from files other than the default *postgresql.conf*

If you don't want to provide the whole PostgreSQL configuration file and only specify certain parameters, you can add your *extended .conf* files to "files/conf.d/" in your working directory. Those files will be mounted as configMap to the containers adding/overwriting the default configuration using the include_dir directive that allows settings to be loaded from files other than the default *postgresql.conf*.

Alternatively, you can specify the extended configuration using the *postgresql.extendedConf* parameter.

In addition to these options, you can also set an external ConfigMap with all the extra configuration files. This is done by setting the *postgresql.extendedConfCM* parameter. Note that this will override the two previous options.
