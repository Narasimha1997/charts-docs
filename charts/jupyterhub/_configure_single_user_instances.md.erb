As explained in the [documentation](https://docs.bitnami.com/kubernetes/infrastructure/jupyterhub/get-started/understand-default-configuration/), the Hub is responsible for deploying the Single User instances. The configuration of these instances is passed to the Hub instance via the *hub.configuration* chart parameter.

In order to make the chart follow Bitnami standards and to ease the generation of this configuration file, the chart has a *singleuser* section, which is then used for generating the *hub.configuration* value. The *hub.configuration* value can be easily overridden by modifying its default value or by providing a secret via the *hub.existingSecret* value. In this case, all the settings in the `singleuser` section will be ignored.

All the settings specified in the *hub.configuration* value are consumed by the *jupyter_config.py* script available in the *templates/hub/configmap.yaml* file. This script can be changed by providing a custom ConfigMap via the *hub.existingConfigmap* value. The [official JupyterHub documentation](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/config-examples.html) has more examples of the *jupyter_config.py* script.
