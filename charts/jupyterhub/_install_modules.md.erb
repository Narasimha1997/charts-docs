Follow the steps below to add support for other Python libraries in the JupyterHub deployment:

* Browse to the service IP address and log in using the credentials set or generated at deployment time.
* Select the "New -> Terminal" menu item. This opens a new web terminal.
* Enter and execute the command below:

        $ export PATH=/opt/bitnami/miniconda/bin:$PATH

* Enter and execute the commands to install the Python libraries required. For example, to install the *matplotlib* library, run the commands below:

        $ pip install matplotlib
        $ exit

The required libraries are downloaded and installed, and become available for use.
