To scale down the Apache cluster, just perform a normal upgrade setting the *replicaCount* value to the desired number of nodes. For example, to reduce the cluster to a single replica, use the command below:

~~~
$ helm upgrade <%= variable :repo_name, :platform %>/apache \
  --set replicaCount=1
~~~
