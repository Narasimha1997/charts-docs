To add a new node to your Apache cluster, you need to upgrade your installation by providing some parameters to the *helm upgrade* command:

* Pass as *rootUser.password* the password used in the installation time. If you did not provide a password follow the intructions from the NOTES.txt to get the generated password.
* Set the desired number of nodes at *replicaCount*.

The following will be an example to add more nodes:

~~~
$ helm upgrade my-release <%= variable :repo_name, :platform %>/apache \
--set rootUser.password=ROOT_PASSWORD \
--set replicaCount=NUMBER_OF_REPLICAS
~~~

> NOTE: You need to substitute the placeholder ROOT_PASSWORD with the value obtained from instructions in the installation notes. Also replace NUMBER_OF_REPLICAS with the total number of nodes you want to add to the existing cluster.
