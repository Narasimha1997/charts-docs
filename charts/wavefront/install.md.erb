> NOTE: To install a Helm chart repository it is necessary to have [Helm previously installed and configured in your cluster](/<%=platform_path %>/faq/get-started/install-configure-helm).

To start using any Bitnami Helm chart, it is necessary to first add the Bitnami Helm chart repository to Helm and then run the *helm install* command to deploy this chart. Follow these steps:

* Add the Bitnami repository to Helm with the following command:

        $ helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami

    A Helm chart describes a specific version of a solution, also known as a "release". The "release" includes files with Kubernetes-needed resources and files that describe the installation, configuration, usage and license of a chart.

* Check that your Kubernetes cluster is running by executing the following command:

        $ kubectl cluster-info

* Create a *wavefront* namespace:

        $ kubectl create namespace wavefront

* Deploy the chart with the following command. As shown below, the command deploys Wavefront on the Kubernetes cluster in the *wavefront* namespace using the configuration. The [Parameters](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/wavefront#parameters) section lists the parameters that can be configured during installation.

  The required parameters are *clusterName*, *wavefront.url* and *wavefront.token*. You will need to provide values for those options for a successful installation of the chart.

        $ helm install MY-RELEASE <%= variable :repository_name, :platform %>/wavefront --namespace wavefront \
        --set clusterName=K8s-CLUSTER-NAME \
        --set wavefront.url=https://YOUR_CLUSTER.wavefront.com \
        --set wavefront.token=YOUR_API_TOKEN

   The command deploys Wavefront on the Kubernetes cluster in the *wavefront* namespace using the configuration. The [Parameters](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/wavefront#parameters) section lists the parameters that can be configured during installation.

   The required parameters are *clusterName*, *wavefront.url* and *wavefront.token*. You will need to provide values for those options for a successful installation of the chart.
