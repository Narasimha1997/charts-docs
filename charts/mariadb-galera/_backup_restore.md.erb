Two different approaches are available to back up and restore <%= variable :catalog_name, :platform %> MariaDB Galera Helm chart deployments on Kubernetes:

* Back up the data from the source deployment and restore it in a new deployment using MariaDB Galera built-in backup/restore tools.

* Back up the persistent volumes from the source deployment and attach them to a new deployment using Velero, a Kubernetes backup/restore tool.

### Method 1: Backup and restore data using MariaDB Galera built-in tools

This method involves the following steps:

* Use the *mysqldump* tool to create a snapshot of the data in the source cluster.
* Create a new MariaDB Galera Cluster deployment and forward the MariaDB Galera Cluster service port for the new deployment.
* Create and start a MariaDB Galera container image to mount a directory containing the backup file as a volume.
* Restore the data using the *mysql* client tool to import the backup to the new cluster.

> NOTE: Under this approach, it is important to create the new deployment on the destination cluster using the same credentials as the original deployment on the source cluster.

### Method 2: Back up and restore persistent data volumes

This method involves copying the persistent data volumes for the MariaDB Galera nodes and reusing them in a new deployment with [Velero](https://velero.io/), an open source Kubernetes backup/restore tool. This method is only suitable when:

* The Kubernetes provider is [supported by Velero](https://velero.io/docs/master/supported-providers/).
* Both clusters are on the same Kubernetes provider, as this is a requirement of [Velero's native support for migrating persistent volumes](https://velero.io/docs/v1.5/migration-case/).
* The restored deployment on the destination cluster will have the same name, namespace, topology and credentials as the original deployment on the source cluster.

This method involves the following steps:
