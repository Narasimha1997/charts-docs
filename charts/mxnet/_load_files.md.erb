The Apache MXNet (Incubating) chart supports three different ways to load your files. In order of priority, they are:

* Existing config map
* Files under the files directory
* Cloning a git repository

This means that if you specify a config map with your files, it won't look for the *files/* directory nor the Git repository.

In order to use use an existing config map you can set the configMap=my-config-map parameter.

To load your files from the *files/* directory you don't have to set any option. Just copy your files inside and don't specify a ConfigMap.

Finally, if you want to clone a git repository you can use the following parameters:

~~~
cloneFilesFromGit.enabled=true
cloneFilesFromGit.repository=https://github.com/my-user/my-repo
cloneFilesFromGit.revision=master
~~~

In case you want to add a file that includes sensitive information, pass a secret object using the existingSecret parameter. All the files in the secret will be mounted in the */secrets* folder.
