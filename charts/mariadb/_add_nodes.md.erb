To add a new node to your MariaDB cluster, upgrade your installation and provide additional parameters to the *helm upgrade* command:

* Set the *auth.rootPassword* parameter to the *root* account password defined at deployment time. For auto-generated passwords, follow the intructions in the deployment notes to get the auto-generated password.
* Set the desired number of nodes using the *secondary.replicaCount* parameter.

The command below is an example of adding more nodes to an existing MariaDB cluster. Replace the ROOT_PASSWORD placeholder with the *root* account password, and the NUMBER_OF_REPLICAS placeholder with the number of secondary nodes needed.

~~~
$ helm upgrade my-release <%= variable :repo_name, :platform %>/mariadb \
  --set auth.rootPassword=ROOT_PASSWORD \
  --set secondary.replicaCount=NUMBER_OF_REPLICAS
~~~
