If you have visualizations and dashboards (in NDJSON format) that you want to import to Kibana. You can create a ConfigMap that includes them and then install the chart with the savedObjects.configmap value: savedObjects.configmap=my-import

Alternatively, if it is available via URL, you can install the chart as follows: savedObjects.urls[0]=www.my-site.com/import.ndjson
