To scale the NATS cluster, just perform a normal upgrade setting the *replicaCount* value to the desired number of nodes. For example, use the command below to scale the cluster up to three replicas:

~~~
$ helm upgrade <%= variable :repo_name, :platform %>/nats \
  --set auth.password=PASSWORD \
  --set replicaCount=3
~~~

> NOTE: You need to substitute the placeholder PASSWORD with the value obtained from instructions in the installation notes (in case of randomly generated passwords) or the password defined at deployment-time.
