To configure the secrets use the following options:

* Secret keys: Secret keys are used for secure communication between components. Fill *core.secret*, *jobservice.secret* and *registry.secret* to configure.
* Certificates: Used for token encryption/decryption. Fill *core.secretName* to configure.

Secrets and certificates must be setup to avoid changes on every Helm upgrade (refer to the [Harbor issues section](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor-helm/issues/107) in its GitHub repository for more information on this).
