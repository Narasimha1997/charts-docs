It is possible to configure hosts that map to your MinIO(R) installation. To configure one or more hosts, follow these instructions:

* Configure one hostname: set the property *ingress.hostname*.
* Configure two or more hostnames:
  * Specify the *ingress.extraHosts* object as an array
  * Use *ingress.extraTLS* to add the TLS configuration for extra hosts

    For each host indicated at *ingress.extraHosts*, please indicate a *name*, *path*, and any *annotations* that you may want the ingress controller to know about.

    > NOTE: For *annotations*, please see this [document](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/master/docs/user-guide/nginx-configuration/annotations.md). Not all annotations are supported by all ingress controllers, but this document does a good job of indicating which annotation is supported by many popular ingress controllers.
