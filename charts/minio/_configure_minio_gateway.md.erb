MinIO(R) can be configured as a gateway for other storage systems. This chart currently supports to setup MinIO(R) as a gateway for the storage systems below:

* [Azure Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/blobs/)
* [GCS](https://cloud.google.com/storage)
* NAS: Network Attached Storage
* [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)

To enable this feature, install the chart setting gateway.enabled to true. You can choose the Gateway type setting the gateway.type parameter. For instance, to install the chart as a S3 Gateway, install the chart the using the following parameters:

    gateway.enabled=true
    gateway.replicaCount=4
    gateway.type=s3
    gateway.auth.s3.serviceEndpoint=https://s3.amazonaws.com
    gateway.auth.s3.accessKey=S3_ACCESS_KEY
    gateway.auth.s3.secretKey=S3_SECRET_KEY

> NOTE: Remember to replace the S3_ACCESS_KEY and S3_SECRET_KEY placeholders with your actual S3 access & secret keys.

Find all the available parameters to configure MinIO(R) as a Gateway in the [gateway parameters section](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/minio#gateway-parameters).

> NOTE: When using MinIO(R) as a NAS Gateway, you need ReadWriteMany PVs to deploy multiple MinIO(R) instances. Ensure you Kubernetes cluster supports this kind of cluster, and install the chart setting *persistence.accessModes[0]* to *ReadWriteMany* to do so.
