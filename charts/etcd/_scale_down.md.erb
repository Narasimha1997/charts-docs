To scale down the etcd cluster, two options are available:

- Scale the StatefulSet using the *kubectl scale* command. For instance, to remove a member, use the commands below:

  ~~~
  $ CURRENT_REPLICAS=$(kubectl get statefulset/my-release-etcd -o=jsonpath='{.status.replicas}')
  $ kubectl scale --replicas=$((CURRENT_REPLICAS-1)) statefulset/my-release-etcd
  ~~~

* Upgrade the StatefulSet by providing the total number of etcd members required in the etcd cluster as a parameter to the *helm upgrade* command.. For instance, to remove two members, use the commands below:

  ~~~
  $ CURRENT_REPLICAS=$(kubectl get statefulset/my-release-etcd -o=jsonpath='{.status.replicas}')
  $ helm upgrade my-release <%= variable :repo_name, :platform %>/etcd \
    --set auth.rbac.rootPassword=ETCD_ROOT_PASSWORD \
    --set replicaCount=$((CURRENT_REPLICAS-2))
  ~~~

  > NOTE: Replace the placeholder ETCD_ROOT_PASSWORD with the correct password for the etcd administrator account. If the password was generated automatically, obtain the auto-generated paassword from the post-deployment instructions.
